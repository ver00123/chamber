<h1>CHAMBER</h1>

<h1>Personality</h1>
<p>With a blend of suave nonchalance, professional poise, and smug comedy, Chamber is fully confident with the skill he provides and the value that he offers. He sets high standards for himself and his team, reminding everyone that if they were to secure victories, they might as well go all-out and be the best in what they do.

    He has shown friendliness with many of the agents in the Protocol, but he is very much aware that he holds many secrets which are better kept hidden.</p>

<h1>Appearance</h1>    
<p>Chamber sports a combover hairstyle and wears a pair of glasses with a thick, rectangular frame. He is seen wearing a blue suit vest over a white long-sleeved shirt, along with a geometrical colorful midnight tie. The said vest has three rifle bullets in place of where the buttons are located. Covering his hands are a pair of brown gloves with white straps that exposes his ring and pinkie fingers. He sports a custom watch with gold straps on his left arm, and he wears a cedar pair of pants held by a belt with white straps and a buckle which sports a unique golden outline. He wears a golden chain clipped across his tie as a strap as well.

    On the left side of his face are several gold nanotech "tattoos", resembling traces found on a printed circuited board. These tattoos also appear on his arms and cover more of his body below his neck. It is these tattoos that form his Tour De Force; when Chamber wants to equip the rifle, the tattoos leave his body to construct it.
    
    Notably, Chamber's entire suit (without his tie) turns into a gold color whenever he is within proximity of a Rendezvous anchor although it is unknown if this is purely a gameplay mechanic given that this is not the case depicted in his agent reveal trailer.</p>

<h1>Biography</h1>
 <p>The Frenchman Vincent Fabron lives his life in search of one necessary goal, willing to sacrifice anything that gets in his way of achieving it. He has spent much of his time involved with combat and weapons, having worked for the French military before becoming a PMC marksman and then a weapons designer for Kingdom Defense. His employment at Kingdom was only a stepping stone for him though, as by this point he was already set on his path in pursuit of his sacred truth.

    One such event that exemplified Fabron's will to continue with his goals no matter the cost surrounds his actions at the Everett-Linde Research Facility in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, where he traveled to around 9 AFL and began communicating with employees there. Fabron soon found himself barred from entering facility grounds shortly after attempting to access their systems but eventually returned to reinstate his security clearance and obtain schematics. However, he was soon forced to make a decision that required him to destroy the facility's Large Radian Collider. Having already made contact with his Omega counterpart, together they fired on the LRC on the day the lab's people were celebrating its supposed success. The resulting explosion killed many of its employees and the facility was reduced to a husk.
    
    Not long after the events of Everett-Linde, Fabron encountered senior VALORANT Protocol agents Brimstone and Viper, where together they were put in an unpleasant situation. After promoting himself as someone who could help VALORANT out with their Omega Project, the Protocol's leadership gave Fabron a position as their eighteenth agent. Becoming "Chamber", he immediately proved himself to be a necessary asset to the VP's goals, providing blueprints necessary to properly construct an Alpha-Omega teleporter, as well as helping with its power issues by recommending a prospective agent with radiant abilities that could help.
    
    Even with his new partnership with the VALORANT Protocol though, Chamber's necessary goal still remains to be achieved. With some of his fellow agents (including some of Earth's most skilled investigators and devoted defenders) already having their suspicions about his motives, Chamber has to tread more carefully than ever before if he is to reach his final objective - and be prepared for judgement when the truth of his character is revealed as a result.</p>
